# Email-Newsletter-for-Outlook
Tried to fix Outlook hassle with tables and succeeded. Tested through Email on Acid and MailChimp - they stay same and doesn't fall apart.  
This template may not be the WOW template but at least it stays same on mobile devices, desktops and most important Outlook email. The code is derived from MS word - since Outlook is same family as Word. 
I used it for betting company for sending quotes direclty linked to sport offer. 
I hope that someone could also use it and avoid painful fall apart in Outlook.
